     "EMOTIONS": {
      "T1": "Dealing with Feelings",
      "L1": "Disorders of emotion regulation (that is, the difficulty of controlling emotions) are at the center of borderline disorder. Violent, often long-lasting, unpleasant feelings determine the experience, the feeling for oneself and the actions of the borderline patients. Most other problems are related to it.",
      "L2": "Even positive feelings can become very strong.",
      "L3": "We can regulate emotions and control appropriate actions. The stronger the emotion, the more difficult it is to control the action impulse. How this works, we will learn in this module.",
      "T2": "What will we Learn?",
      "L4": "Observing, describing and understanding feelings and meanings.",
      "L5": "Reduce emotional vulnerability and give more space to positive emotions.",

      "L15": "What do we know about emotions?",
      "L16": "What are emotions?",
      "L17": "Emotions are automated and learned responses to inner and outer stimuli or information.",
      "L18": "Emotions push for certain actions.",
      "L19": "We distinguish emotions (short and fast changing) and moods (longer and more stable) - such as weather and climate.",
      "L20": "How do emotions work?",
      "L21": "Emotions are responsible for our well-being and also for how we behave towards others - in other words, for our social behavior. It helps to understand how they work:",
      "L22": "Emotions usually arise quickly and pass quickly again.",
      "L23": "Emotions make us feel alive.",
      "L24": "Strong emotions lead to strong physical excitement.",
      "L25": "Strong emotions develop strong pressure to act and are difficult to question. In other words, intense emotions crowd into our experience and determine it. (Emotions 'make themselves important' and 'love themselves'.)",
      "L26": "Emotions control our behavior. This is often not conscious. But we try to avoid unpleasant emotions and to get pleasant emotions. Emotions motivate us and prepare our actions.",
      "L27": "Emotions are strongly influenced by our life experience. A student who has been laughed at and teased several times because of his clumsy movements in physical education, will be ashamed of a derogatory remark in the schoolyard about his new sneakers rather than someone who regularly leads the football team to victory and is therefore admired by all.",
      "L28": "Emotions say nothing about reality, but only about how we interpret and evaluate reality. If we read the SMS 'Thank you, you were great yesterday ;-)', on the phone of our friend and interpret this as a secret thanks for an infidelity, we are of course jealous. But if we know that thanks to this a classmate thanked, because he has got from him the decisive tip to solve the math problem, we are probably proud of him.",
      "L29": "Our emotions also affect other people. Our facial expressions, posture and gestures can communicate information faster than words. When someone has tears in his eyes and looks down, we probably think he is sad and want to comfort him.",
      "L30": "Emotions can give us important information about the situation. For example, if we are scared, we think that the current situation is dangerous, and we will move very carefully. If we are ashamed, then we filter our environment very closely for clues of social rejection and try not to attract attention. If we are jealous, we will automatically register all references to suspicious emails very carefully, and when we are freshly in love, we will see every little bit of elegance and beauty hidden in our prince in bright colors.",
      "L31": "We can also control emotions. Our brain can amplify and weaken emotions. This can be trained."
